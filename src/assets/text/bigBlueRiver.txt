We've reached the fifth river of our journey. Thankfully, I overheard some fellow travelers gratefully talking about how it's also the final river of the entire trail.
As much as I dislike all this traveling, the fact that we're at the exact same river as our first crossing makes this experience so much worse.
It feels like we've gone nowhere, and frankly, I still wish we could go nowhere. I miss Missouri.
I hope these rivers are more exciting for you than they are for me. Until tomorrow.
