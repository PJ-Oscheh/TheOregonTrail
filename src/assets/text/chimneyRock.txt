We’ve just reached another landmark. Do you want to guess what it is?
It’s a rock.
Again.
But at least it has a different name!
We’re at Chimney Rock.
It’s smaller than the previous one, but it’s still at least hundreds of feet tall.
I am sure that you would have loved to be here.
I’m sure you would have made a joke about me being Chimney Rock while you were Courthouse and Jail Rock, since you always were just that inch or two taller than me.
I’ll talk to you tomorrow, have a good day Becky.
