We've reached the Three Island Crossing.
When those previous travelers mentioned that Big Blue was the final river, I guess they meant it was the final one we would have to cross over.
I'm not disappointed though. This view is one that I wish I could have with me for the rest of my life.
I am starting to see why you so longed to travel, and I am grateful that I have gained the appreciation that you have always had for this sort of thing.
The river is absolutely beautiful, and it makes me appreciate how pretty nature can be.
It makes me chuckle to think about how much I took this for granted when we set out, and I only wish I could experience those starting five rivers, so I could truly appreciate them for how they are.
Until I talk to you again! Wish us luck!
