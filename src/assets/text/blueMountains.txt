We’ve reached the Blue Mountains, and have also finally reached Oregon.
When we arrived here, the sight was stunning. My eyes fell upon somber cliffs, blue gorges, and snow clad turrets.
I truly am fond of these ever-changing landscapes, and it makes me excited to think about where we are going to go next.
If this journey has taught me anything, it’s that life without change is not a life I’d like to live.
I still can’t believe that I was the one to write to you about traveling instead of vice-versa, but I am very grateful that I was able to experience these sights firsthand.
I feel like it has helped me to gain an appreciation that I would have otherwise lacked. I am happy that you and I were able to make this journey together.
We’re almost there! I’ll talk to you tomorrow, Becky.
