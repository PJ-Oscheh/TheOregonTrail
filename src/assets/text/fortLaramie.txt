We’ve finally reached the second fort. This one is Fort Laramie.
We’ll once again be able to sell and restock, and this time I’m more ready than ever to gather the supplies we need.
According to some friendly travelers, Fort Laramie was founded very recently. One of the founders is apparently the same man that Fort Bridger is named after, our next landmark.
Apparently Fort Laramie marks the first of a trilogy of forts that we’ll be going to. So, we should be able to be set on supplies for a short while, so long as we’re smart.
It also marks the first landmark of Wyoming.
Looking back, we are so far away from Missouri now, but I know that you would be proud of how far we have come. I know you would encourage us to forge onward.
Thanks for everything you have done for me. Until tomorrow!
