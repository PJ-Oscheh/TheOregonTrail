We've reached Fort Bridger!
This marks the halfway point in our journey, and honestly, it is amazing to me how far we have come.
I never thought when we set out that we would actually make it this far, but I'm certainly not going to complain that we have.
While I was walking around the fort today, it hit me how many people were there.All of these people are looking for the same thing:
a better life.
It inspires me. We are not the only ones on this journey. So many people sacrificed their previous lives just like we did.
We have to make it to Oregon. We can't let anything stop us now.
I'll write again to you tomorrow! I hope you're doing well sis.
