We've reached the third and final fort of the trilogy: Fort Hall.
This is by far the biggest trading post we have been at yet. After this, there are only three more checkpoints before we reach Oregon.
We're so close. This checkpoint marks the first one in Idaho, and we are officially only one state away from our destination.
That thought completely reinvigorates me, and I am fully ready to continue this journey. Just about 750 miles to go, and then we'll be in Oregon City.
I talked to some of the other travelers, and they told me about the fascinating history of this place, such as how Native Americans had guided Lewis and Clark along the paths that went by this fort.
It is interesting to think about how we have traveled a path just like those two well-known explorers, all the way from the Kansas River.
Here's to the last quarter! I'm looking forward to writing to you tomorrow.
