We've reached the next location, and shocker, it's a river. I'm really getting tired of all this water.
Momma and Pa assured me that there will be actual landmarks later on, but I can't exactly say that that's reassuring.
I just look forward to when we no longer have to look forward to the next landmark, and I can instead just enjoy a normal life rather than all this hustle and bustle from traveling.
Oh, and now we're in Nebraskaâ€¦ another state away from where you are. I miss you.
I'll write to you tomorrow. Take care.
