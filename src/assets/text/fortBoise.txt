We've reached the final fort of our adventure, Fort Boise.
Apparently it was developed as a Hudson Bay Company Trading post, and it was first found during the Astor Expedition led by John Reid, and it was meant to serve as an outpost for expanding into Native territory.
However, when he and his men attempted to defend the land, they were apparently killed by the Natives. It's crazy to think that we are staying at a place that could become a historical battlefield in the future.
I wonder if people will talk about the fight that happened here in the future. The stories that surround this place are fascinating, but I don't want to talk too much about it.
This fort also marks the three quarters point of our journey. After this, there is only one landmark between us and Oregon.
I am looking forward to reaching that location: the Blue Mountains. Travelers here have talked about how beautiful the landscape is, and I can't wait to get there.
We'll be officially crossing into Oregon soon.
Here's to our next adventure! Until tomorrow!
