The second location of note we’ve reached is another river. According to Pa, this is the Kansas River.
He told me about how the river was first mapped out 100 years ago, and that the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped out here around the turn of the century.
He seemed absolutely enthralled by this topic, but honestly I don’t get the appeal.
One thing that the river does have going for it is that it is fairly pretty. It was kind of nice to look out onto the endless blue and take in the sights.
Definitely not worth the trip to get here though, and I don’t expect I’ll be seeing this view again for a very long time.
I’ll talk to you again tomorrow, assuming this awful trip hasn’t killed me.
