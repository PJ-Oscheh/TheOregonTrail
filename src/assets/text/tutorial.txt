Welcome to The Oregon Trail! Press 'C' to commence forth!
First, you must go to the shop and gather items for your journey.
But make sure you weight every purchase carefully. You'll want enough of everything to make it to Oregon!
After your shopping spree, it'll be time to travel the trail!
In order to travel one day, type 'T' and press enter.
Each day the weather changes, your party will grow more hungry if not fed, and a random event may occur,
so make sure to check your stats and watch out! Make sure at least one of your party members eats every 2 days!
It's not all bad though, because each day you get two daily activities which can boost party happiness, leading to a smoother traveling experience!
In order to feed, clothe, and cure your party, you'll need to access your inventory.
To access your inventory, type 'I' and press enter.
Tread the trail steadily, and good luck!
