We've made it! We finally made it to Oregon City.
I can not believe how far we have come.
I hope you're proud of us, Becky. I don't think I could have stayed sane on this trip without you.
I also don't think I would have appreciated this trip nearly as much if it weren't for the influence that you have on me.
While I am grateful that our journey, and our dangers, are over, I am going to miss navigating the trail and appreciating the views.
I hope that, in the future, I will be able to travel again.
Thank you for everything Becky! I'm grateful that we made this trip together! I'll talk to you again in my next entry. I love you.
