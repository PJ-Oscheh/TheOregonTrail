The tender grass of early spring flatten beneath me, showing the wavering tracks of my footsteps, sere and brown.
I think looking back, seeing that trail of endless footsteps behind me, has helped me to fully understand that there truly is no going back.
There will be no return to Missouri. I have to move on. Moreover, I have to carry on. For you. For us.
I will talk to you tomorrow. I look forward to writing to you in the future.
