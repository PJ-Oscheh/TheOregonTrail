We’ve finally reached Fort Kearny. Pa says we’ll be able to restock and sell goods here.
I encountered a peculiar old man a few moments ago (emphasis on old). His face was wrinkled and worn by past and gone smiles. He seemed like a happy man, but he was crying when I met him.
When I asked him what was wrong, he told me he lost his grandson to scarlet fever on the trail a day before arriving here. He began to cry a little harder. The type of cry where you hold your breath, but you’re still shaking. He shook real hard.
I empathize with him. Scarlet fever is what took you away from me, so I understood how he felt.
He began talking about his life a bit, and he mentioned that his son-in-law helped build Fort Kearny in 1848 with the goal of helping out travelers like us.
Apparently this is the first of many forts. I still don’t get why so many people are traveling. There’s nothing but grass and rocks out here. Frankly, you aren’t missing much.
I want to go home.
That’s the update for today. I’ll be sure to write to you tomorrow. Farewell.
