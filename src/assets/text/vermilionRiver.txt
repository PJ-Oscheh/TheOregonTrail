We’ve now reached the Vermillion River. Just when I thought that these rivers might be somewhat interesting, vermillion’s beauty completely disappoints me, and falls flat compared to what I saw at the Kansas River.
All I could think about when I looked out onto it was how dull it was compared to where we just were.
I absolutely despise every day that we spend on this trail, and I would do anything to have things go back to how they were before we embarked on this journey.
Until next time. I hope you are doing well.
