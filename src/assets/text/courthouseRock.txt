We just arrived at Courthouse and Jail Rocks. Momma said it’s a “landmark,” and claims that it’s over 400 feet tall.
I heard one traveler talking to Pa earlier. He said that it "resembles the ruins of an old castle, rising abruptly from the plain....It is difficult to look upon it and not believe that art had something to do with its construction. The voyagers have called it the Courthouse; but it looks infinitely more like the Capitol."
I feel like that’s a bit of an exaggeration. It’s a rock.
....but I guess it’s a little cool. Only a little. It’s definitely something you’d fawn over.
The trip has been tiring so far, but you keep me motivated. I hope you’re doing well.
I’ll write to you tomorrow. Farewell
