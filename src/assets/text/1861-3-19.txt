Aunt Janet gave me this diary a few days ago, suggesting I “record my journey” to Oregon. It feels odd writing to nobody, so I decided to write to you instead.
It’s a freezing, brisk morning in Independence Missouri. There are children running around right now, seemingly without a care in the world. I envy them.
They’re too young to understand what’s about to happen. Over 2,000 miles of untraveled trail lay ahead of us, and the prospect is terrifying.
I’m sure you would have loved it though. You would have seen it as a chance to travel the country and experience everything this world has to offer.
But a trip like this can turn south in the blink of an eye. I understand the move is necessary, but I can’t help but hate the situation.
Why should I have to leave home? The home I grew up in. The home I cherish. The home where you lay resting. But after today I will never see our home again.
I’m trying to remain composed so Ben and Jake won’t be too scared, but I’m terrified myself. Terrified for what’s in store.
But despite everything, I have a goal in mind, and I must travel this trail successfully to reach it. You’ve always wanted to see the world, and I’m determined to show it to you through these pages.
I’ll explore the world for you, Becky.
