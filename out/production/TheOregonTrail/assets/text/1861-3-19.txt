Aunt Janet gave me this diary a few days ago, suggesting I “record my journey” to Oregon. It feels odd writing to nobody, so I decided to write to you instead.
It’s a freezing, brisk morning in Independence, Missouri. There are children running around right now, seemingly without a care in the world. I envy them. They’re too young to understand what’s about to happen.
Over 2,000 miles of untraveled trail lay ahead of us, and the prospect is terrifying.
I’m sure you would have loved it though. You would have seen it as a chance to travel the country and experience everything this world has to offer.
But a trip like this can turn south in the blink of an eye.
I understand the move is necessary, but I can’t help but hate the situation. Why should I have to leave home? The home I grew up in. The home I cherish.
The home where you lay resting.
After today I’ll never see our home again. I’m trying to remain composed for Ben and Jake, but I’m terrified myself. Terrified for what’s in store.
I came up with a fun idea last night though. I think I’m going to dedicate this diary to you. I’ll document my journey so you can travel the world, just like you wanted to.
I’ll travel the trail for you, Becky.
