The tender grass of early spring flatten beneath me, showing the wavering tracks of my footsteps, sere and brown.
We’re on our way to Hiram Young’s Shop on North Liberty Street so we can purchase a Wagon. The shop is in Independence, so the walk shouldn’t be too bad.
We can only carry so much, so we must carefully weigh out our options.
Too much food will leave us with little clothing and water, but too much clothing will leave us with little food or water and clothing. We also have to consider how much it costs.
I wonder what we’ll do...
