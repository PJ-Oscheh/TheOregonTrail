Paste old classes here in case we gotta look at em for reference


Wagon.java
Reason for deleting: Cold is old and probably crusty
Code:

/**
 * The Wagon class keeps track of all consumables in an array known as the "Consumable Partition."
 * It can generate Consumable objects and append them to said array, as well as remove
 * Consumable objects at a specified index. The number of Consumable objects in the
 * Consumable Partition can be returned as well.
 *
 * The Wagon class also keeps track of the current pace of the wagon, as an integer. A pace of
 * 1 = resting, 2 = steady, 3 = strenuous, and 4 = grueling.
 *
 * This class also keeps track of the amount of rations available to the party. When there are
 * 3 pounds (instances) of Consumables available to each party member, the size is "filling."
 * For 2 pounds per party member, the size is "meager."
 * For 1 pound per party member, the size is "bare bones."

CheckIfLost.java
Reason for deleting: We probably won't end the game with an object
Code:

public class CheckIfLost {

    //if the game is lost.

    //Perhaps it can just be moved to the GUI. Maybe it's more appropriate on its own. Idk.
